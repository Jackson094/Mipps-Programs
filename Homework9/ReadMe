Write a subroutine that takes one temperature in Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit using
the approximate formula f =
c·9
5 + 32.
The main routine, in a loop, prompts the user for a value of a temperature and prints out the
result. End the loop when the user enters an integer out of the range of [−50, 50].
