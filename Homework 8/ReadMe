# Homework 8 -- Euclid's Algorithm
#
#  Find the Greatest Common Divisor of two integers.

#  1.  Call the two integers large and small
#  2.  If small is equal to 0, 
#         stop: large is the GCD
#  3.  Divide large by small, call the remainder small. The previous small becomes large
#  4.  Repeat steps 2 thru 4.
#
#  Registers:
#
#   $s1 -- small
#   $s2 -- large
#  
#
#   $a0 -- address of prompt
#   $v0 -- trap handler code, user input
